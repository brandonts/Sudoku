# Sudoku-Solver

This Repository is for me to develop a C++ program that solves sudoku puzzles.

Currently there is:
  (1) a SudokuPuzzle class that holds the data structure and controls the data.
  (2) a SudokuSolver function that contains all of the logic for solving a SudokuPuzzle.

To do List:  
  (1) set up a testing suite to make sure everything is working properly.
	-sudoku_solver.cc rename to sudoku_tester.cc
	-

Future possibilities:
  (1) gui for entering a puzzle to be solved
