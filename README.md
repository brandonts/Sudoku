# Sudoku-Solver

This Repository is for me to develop a C++ program that solves sudoku puzzles.
Initially there will be:
  (1) a SudokuPuzzle class that holds the data structure and controls the data.
  (2) a SudokuSolver function that contains all of the logic for solving a SudokuPuzzle.
  
Future possibilities:
  (1) gui for entering a puzzle to be solved
